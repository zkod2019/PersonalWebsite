        Hi, I'm Zaya! I am a fresh computer systems engineering graduate, based
        in Dubai, that is interested in web, app, and game development.
      </p>
      <p>
        While studying at Middlesex University, I worked at companies like
        Mixfame and Borders, while also spending my time as a teacher assistant.
        I taught subjects such as Networking, Project Management, and taught
        students to code in Python, VHDL, and C.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am comfortable programming in Java, JavaScript (HTML&CSS), C#, and
        Python.
